var popup = function(feature) { }; // from there, create a popup
var clear = function() {}; // again, just clear the map

var slide = function() {}; // no input; each slide will need to have code—literally—encoding it
var showslide = function(index) {}; // once a button has been clicked, we need to move through the slides

var clicknext = function() {}; // These will have no inputs, but will only happen on a click
var clickprev = function() {}; // Though, my dream is to have it happen on a scroll
