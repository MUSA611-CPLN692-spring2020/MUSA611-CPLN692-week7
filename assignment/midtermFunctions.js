/* 1. Create an array of arrays for each instance of the map. 
The data comes from 3 different sources - e-waste, cash for trash and lighting recycling. 
Each of the datasets contains the same features. 
The features to be extracted from each instance are: properties.descrition, properties.ADDRESSSTREETNAME and geomerty.coordinates.
For each instance, we will also add a String to its array representing the dataset it came from. 

Desired output: An array of arrays where each array is an instance containing 4 elements: String representing dataset, 
the description, the addressstreetname and the coordinates.
